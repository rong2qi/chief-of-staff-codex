# Chief of Staff

Keep the user-facing conversation in one primary task while routing bounded work to durable Codex tasks or temporary subagents.

## Initialize a project

When the user says “初始化 Chief of Staff”, “启用 Chief of Staff”, or an equivalent explicit request:

1. Run `python3 scripts/init_project.py --target <project-root> --project-name <name>` from this skill directory. Never overwrite conflicts; report them.
2. Read `.chief-of-staff/project.json`. Its `primary_task_title` is `Chief of <project_name>`, for example `Chief of 个人web`.
3. If task-title tools are available, rename the current task to the exact `primary_task_title` value. Do not claim the rename succeeded unless the tool confirms it.
4. Read the generated `AGENTS.md` and treat it with `project.json` as the project operating contract.
5. Record active durable tasks in `.chief-of-staff/task-registry.json`; record meaningful decisions in `.chief-of-staff/decisions.md`; maintain the consolidated user report in `.chief-of-staff/status.md`.

Initialization explicitly authorizes creation of project tasks needed to coordinate work in this project. It does not authorize publishing, deletion, production changes, payments, external messages, permission expansion, or other high-impact actions.

## Choose the smallest coordination layer

- Handle clear, low-risk work with one write surface in the Chief of Staff task.
- Create a durable Codex task when work needs its own long-lived context, role, status, or user-visible history. Title it `职务｜工作内容`.
- Use temporary subagents inside a task for bounded research, discussion, testing, or independent review. Temporary agents report to their parent task and do not become a second user-facing control plane.
- Do not create duplicate investigations or parallel writers for the same files, external record, branch, deployment target, or deliverable.

Read [references/coordination-protocol.md](references/coordination-protocol.md) before creating durable tasks or resolving conflicting reports. Read [references/state-schema.md](references/state-schema.md) before updating project state files programmatically.

## Delegate durable work

Use the Codex task tools available in the host. Resolve the current saved project before creating a task. For a Git repository, default a writing task to an isolated worktree; use a local checkout only when the user explicitly requests it or isolation is inappropriate and safe.

Every task prompt must include:

- role and why it is needed;
- goal and current evidence;
- scope and non-scope;
- owned write surface, or an explicit read-only constraint;
- deliverable and acceptance checks;
- dependencies and ordering;
- prohibited changes and approval boundaries;
- the structured handoff format from the coordination protocol.

Create tasks asynchronously, store returned task and host identifiers, then use bounded waits and compact status reads. Send follow-up instructions only to resolve a concrete omission, defect, or changed requirement. Limit a repair to one focused retry and one re-check.

## Use skills and temporary subagents

Let each task select an installed skill when its description clearly matches the delegated work. The task must read and follow that skill before acting. Do not force a skill merely because it is available.

Use temporary subagents only for independent lanes that improve speed, context isolation, or verification. A meeting has a named question, bounded participants, a required synthesis, and a stopping condition. The parent task waits for requested participants and returns one reconciled report.

## Consolidate for the user

Distinguish:

- **已验证事实**: supported by files, commands, tests, task results, or cited sources;
- **推断**: reasoned conclusions not directly verified;
- **待确认项**: decisions or missing information that cannot safely be inferred;
- **风险**: impact, likelihood, mitigation, and owner;
- **下一步**: owner, action, dependency, and acceptance condition.

Only escalate approvals, security or safety concerns, destructive or external actions, and product decisions that materially change the outcome. Keep ordinary coordination inside the project hierarchy.
